###  Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks :

1. Data loading and inspection.

2. Handling missing values.

3. Data  cleaning and formating.


### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summaried as follows :

1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over month by month , with a noticable peak during the holiday season.

2. Product Category A is the beast performing category in term of sales and revenue.

3. Customer segments with high lifetime value(LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.
  

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions :

- Insert in marketing and protections  during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue and brand visibility.

- Focus on expanding and promoting  products in category A.

- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations.

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they  would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis.There
are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
